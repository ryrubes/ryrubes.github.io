            <h2>2. Penetration Testing</h2>
            <p>Our penetration testing service simulates real-world attacks on your applications to uncover vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Our team uses both manual and automated techniques to test your application’s defenses, ensuring that critical security flaws are discovered and remediated before they can be exploited.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Web application penetration testing (including authentication, authorization, and session management)</li>
                <li>API penetration testing</li>
                <li>Detailed vulnerability reports with remediation guidance</li>

            <h2>3. Source Code Review</h2>
            <p>Our source code review service involves a thorough analysis of your application’s codebase to identify security vulnerabilities at the code level. We focus on common application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure cryptography. We also ensure adherence to secure coding practices to reduce the risk of exploits.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Static code analysis for common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection)</li>
                <li>Manual code review for business logic vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Security best practices and compliance check (OWASP, GDPR, etc.)</li>
